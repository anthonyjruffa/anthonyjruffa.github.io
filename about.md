I studied computer science at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute][wpi] and completed my degree in 2016. Since then, I have been working as a software engineer on the 3PAR FilePersona data storage team for [Hewlett Packard Enterprise][hpe] in Andover, MA.

Most of the programming I currently do is in Java. I also build web applications with JavaScript and Ruby as well as mobile apps. In addition to working at HPE, I work on applications for the [Open Network][opennetwork] team at [Life.Church][lifechurch], and I have made some contributions to the open source community.
